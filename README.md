# My dotfiles

There's not much to say about this to be honest.

## What do I use?

Right now I'm using Windows 10 for C# and other M$ things, and also web dev.
For everything else I use WSL since I'm too lazy to dualboot.
On WSL I use bash, Neovim, and sometimes VS Code.
My terminal of choice is Windows Terminal, since I'm on Windows for now.
