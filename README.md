# My dotfiles

There's not much else to say about this tbh. Feel free to copy and personalize these to your needs.

## What do I use?

Right now I'm using Windows 10 for gaming, web development, and some other M$ specific things.
For everything else I use WSL since I'm too lazy to dualboot.
On WSL I use bash, Neovim, and VS Code.
My terminal of choice is Windows Terminal, since I'm on Windows for now.
