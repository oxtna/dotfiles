# My dotfiles

There's not much else to say about this tbh. Feel free to copy and personalize these to your needs.

## What do I use?

Right now I'm using Windows 10 for gaming, web development, and some other M$ specific things.
Since I'm too lazy to dualboot, I have WSL set up on my machine and use it for everything Unix related.
On WSL I use bash, Neovim, and VS Code, among other tools.
My terminal of choice is Windows Terminal, since I'm on Windows for now.
